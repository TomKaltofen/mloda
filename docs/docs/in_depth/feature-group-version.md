# Feature Group Versioning

## Overview

Feature Group versioning in mloda provides a way to track changes, manage compatibility, and aid debugging. This document explains how the versioning system works and how it's used in feature groups.

## Key Concepts

### Composite Version Identifier

The version identifier is generated by combining:
- The version of the 'mloda' package
- The module name where the feature group is defined
- A SHA-256 hash of the feature group class's source code

This creates a unique identifier that represents the implementation state of the feature group.

### The FeatureGroupVersion Class

The `FeatureGroupVersion` class handles the versioning logic:

```python
@classmethod
def version(cls) -> str:
    """
    Returns a composite version identifier for this feature group.
    """
    return FeatureGroupVersion.version(cls)
```

## Benefits

- **Change Detection**: Easily detect when a feature group implementation has changed
- **Compatibility Management**: Ensure compatibility between different versions
- **Debugging**: Trace issues back to specific implementations
- **Reproducibility**: Recreate results with the same feature group version
