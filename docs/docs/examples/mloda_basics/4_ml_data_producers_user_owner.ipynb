    "In this notebook, we explored the roles of Data Producers, Data Users, and Data Owners within mloda. We delved into the responsibilities and functionalities associated with each role, highlighting how they contribute to the overall data lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Producers are responsible for implementing the plugins, ensuring the accuracy of data access processes, and defining relevant configuration options\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Users create usage configuration and apply the mlodaAPI to receive data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Owners, while not fully covered in this open-source offering, they are critical for governance and ensuring the ongoing availability and maintenance of essential plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these roles and their interactions, shows how mloda's modular and extensible design is vital in bringing the change to efficient data management practices and processing throughout the machine learning lifecycle"

    "While mloda holds a great potential to become a unified portal, we face a key challenge: its plugin coverage is not comprehensive enough to integrate seamlessly across all available tools and technologies. Therefore, active community contributions are absolutely essential to accelerate both its adoption and its ability to transform data management practices"
