# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Initializing the memory bank for the mloda project.

## Recent Changes

*   Created the initial memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.
*   Added README.md files to top-level directories: `mloda_core/`, `mloda_plugins/`, and `tests/` to improve documentation.
*   Added description and versioning capabilities to AbstractFeatureGroup:
    * Created `FeatureGroupVersion` class to handle versioning logic
*   Created a dedicated `feature_groups.md` file in the memory bank to document Feature Groups
*   Implemented BaseAggregatedFeatureGroup pattern:
    * Created a modular folder structure with separate files for base and implementation classes
    * Implemented feature name validation with proper error handling
    * Added Pandas implementation with support for common aggregation operations
*   Created `proposed_feature_groups.md` with new feature group categories
*   Implemented TimeWindowFeatureGroup:
    * Integrated with global filter functionality
*   Implemented MissingValueFeatureGroup:
    * Created pattern for handling missing values in features
    * Implemented multiple imputation methods: mean, median, mode, constant, ffill, bfill
    * Added support for grouped imputation based on categorical features

## Next Steps

*   Integration test a feature that aggregates timewindowed imputed features
    * Combine TimeWindowFeatureGroup, MissingValueFeatureGroup, and AggregatedFeatureGroup
    * Demonstrate the composability of feature groups in the mloda framework
    * Create comprehensive test cases with different data scenarios
*   Continue implementing the remaining high-priority proposed feature groups
*   Populate the memory bank files with more detailed information.
*   Update the `.clinerules` file with project-specific patterns.
*   Implement additional compute framework implementations for other feature groups
## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   Determining the best way to structure the memory bank for optimal information retrieval.
*   Identifying key project patterns to document in the `.clinerules` file.
