## Previous Major Accomplishments

*   Implemented PyArrow Filter Engine functionality:
    * Added `filter_engine` method to PyarrowTable class
    * Achieved feature parity with PandasFilterEngine for filtering operations

*   Created the initial memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.
*   Added README.md files to top-level directories: `mloda_core/`, `mloda_plugins/`, and `tests/` to improve documentation.
*   Added description and versioning capabilities to AbstractFeatureGroup:
    * Created `FeatureGroupVersion` class to handle versioning logic
*   Created a dedicated `feature_groups.md` file in the memory bank to document Feature Groups
*   Implemented AggregatedFeatureGroup pattern:
    * Created a modular folder structure with separate files for base and implementation classes
    * Implemented feature name validation with proper error handling
    * Added Pandas implementation with support for common aggregation operations
*   Created `proposed_feature_groups.md` with new feature group categories
*   Implemented TimeWindowFeatureGroup:
    * Integrated with global filter functionality
*   Implemented MissingValueFeatureGroup:
    * Created pattern for handling missing values in features
    * Implemented multiple imputation methods: mean, median, mode, constant, ffill, bfill
    * Added support for grouped imputation based on categorical features
*   Implemented FeatureChainParserConfiguration:
    * Created a configuration-based approach for feature chain parsing
    * Moved feature_chain_parser.py to core components
    * Enhanced AggregatedFeatureGroup, MissingValueFeatureGroup, TimeWindowFeatureGroup with configuration-based creation
    * Added support for creating features from options rather than explicit feature names
*   Implemented TextCleaningFeatureGroup with Pandas support:
    * Added support for text normalization, stopword removal, punctuation removal, etc.
    * Integrated with FeatureChainParserConfiguration for configuration-based creation
    * Added behavior note: different options create different feature sets in results
*   Implemented ClusteringFeatureGroup with Pandas support:
    * Supports various clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical, etc.)
*   Implemented GeoDistanceFeatureGroup with Pandas support:
    * Added support for haversine, euclidean, and manhattan distance calculations
*   Unified the implementation of configurable_feature_chain_parser across all feature groups
*   Implemented Multiple Result Columns support:
    * Added `identify_naming_convention` method to ComputeFrameWork
    * Updated DimensionalityReductionFeatureGroup to use the pattern
*   Implemented ForecastingFeatureGroup with Pandas support:
    * Added support for multiple forecasting algorithms (linear, ridge, randomforest, etc.)
    * Implemented automatic feature engineering for time series data
    * Added artifact support for saving and loading trained models
*   Implemented NodeCentralityFeatureGroup with Pandas support:
    * Added support for multiple centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, pagerank)
    * Implemented matrix-based centrality calculations without requiring external graph libraries
    * Added support for both directed and undirected graphs
*   Completed comprehensive documentation for feature groups:
    * Added in-depth documentation in `docs/docs/in_depth/` directory.
*   Added documentation for framework transformers:
    * Added docstrings to `BaseTransformer`, `ComputeFrameworkTransformer`, and `PandasPyarrowTransformer` classes
    * Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/docs/in_depth/framework-transformers.md`
    * Updated navigation in `docs/mkdocs.yml` to include the new documentation
    * Added references in related documentation files
*   Implemented PythonDict Compute Framework:
*   **Completed PythonDict Feature Group Examples:**
    * MissingValueFeatureGroup PythonDict implementation with comprehensive tests
    * TextCleaningFeatureGroup PythonDict implementation with comprehensive tests
*   **Completed Polars Compute Framework Implementation:**
    * Implemented complete Polars compute framework with PolarsDataframe class


## Next Steps

*   Add integration tests for filtering with both compute frameworks
*   Populate the memory bank files with more detailed information
*   Update the `.clinerules` file with project-specific patterns

## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   Determining the best way to structure the memory bank for optimal information retrieval.
*   Identifying key project patterns to document in the `.clinerules` file.
