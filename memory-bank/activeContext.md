# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Initializing the memory bank for the mloda project.

## Recent Changes

*   Created the initial memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.
*   Added README.md files to top-level directories: `mloda_core/`, `mloda_plugins/`, and `tests/` to improve documentation.
*   Added description and versioning capabilities to AbstractFeatureGroup:
    * Created `FeatureGroupVersion` class to handle versioning logic
*   Created a dedicated `feature_groups.md` file in the memory bank to document Feature Groups
*   Implemented BaseAggregatedFeatureGroup pattern:
    * Created a modular folder structure with separate files for base and implementation classes
    * Implemented feature name validation with proper error handling
    * Added Pandas implementation with support for common aggregation operations
*   Implemented PyArrow aggregated feature group:

## Next Steps

*   Populate the memory bank files with more detailed information.
*   Update the `.clinerules` file with project-specific patterns.
*   Implement additional compute framework implementations for other feature groups
## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   Determining the best way to structure the memory bank for optimal information retrieval.
*   Identifying key project patterns to document in the `.clinerules` file.
