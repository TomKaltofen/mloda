# Project Brief

## Project Goals

The mloda project aims to rethink data and feature engineering by offering a flexible, resilient framework that adapts seamlessly to changes. It focuses on defining transformations rather than static states, facilitating smooth transitions between development phases, and reducing redundant work.

## Core Requirements

*   Provide a flexible and resilient framework for data and feature engineering.
*   Focus on defining transformations rather than static states.
*   Facilitate smooth transitions between development phases.
*   Reduce redundant work.
*   Maintain high data quality, governance, and scalability.
*   Enable efficient querying and processing of complex features.
*   Promote the sharing and reuse of plugins through a centralized repository.
*   Unify various tools such as data catalogs, feature stores, versioning systems, metadata stores, data contracts, and data lineage tools into one cohesive solution.
