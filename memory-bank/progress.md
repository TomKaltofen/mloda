# Progress

## What Works

*   Added README.md files to top-level directories: `mloda_core/`, `mloda_plugins/`, and `tests/` to improve documentation.
*   Added description and versioning capabilities to AbstractFeatureGroup
*   Created a dedicated `feature_groups.md` file in the memory bank to document Feature Groups
*   Implemented AggregatedFeatureGroup with Pandas support for common aggregation operations
*   Created modular folder structure for feature group implementations
*   Implemented PyArrow version of the aggregated feature group
*   Implemented TimeWindowFeatureGroup with both Pandas and PyArrow support
*   Implemented MissingValueFeatureGroup with support for multiple imputation methods:
    * Mean, median, mode imputation for numerical data
    * Constant value imputation for any data type
    * Forward/backward fill for sequential data
    * Support for grouped imputation based on categorical features
*   Implemented FeatureChainParserConfiguration for configuration-based feature creation:
    * Moved feature_chain_parser.py to core components for better organization
    * Added support for creating features from options rather than explicit feature names
    * Enhanced AggregatedFeatureGroup, MissingValueFeatureGroup,TimeWindowFeatureGroup with configuration-based creation
    * Added integration tests demonstrating the new functionality
*   Implemented TextCleaningFeatureGroup with Pandas support:
    * Added support for text normalization, stopword removal, punctuation removal, etc.
    * Integrated with FeatureChainParserConfiguration for configuration-based creation
    * Added behavior note: different options create different feature sets in results
*   Implemented ClusteringFeatureGroup with Pandas support:
    * Supports K-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical, spectral, and affinity clustering
    * Automatic determination of optimal cluster count
    * Standardized feature scaling and missing value handling
*   Implemented GeoDistanceFeatureGroup with Pandas support:
    * Added support for haversine, euclidean, and manhattan distance calculations
    * Integrated with FeatureChainParserConfiguration for configuration-based creation
    * Added comprehensive unit and integration tests
*   Unified the implementation of configurable_feature_chain_parser across all feature groups
*   Implemented DimensionalityReductionFeatureGroup with Pandas support:
    * Added support for PCA, t-SNE, ICA, LDA, and Isomap algorithms
    * Implemented array-in-a-column approach for storing dimensionality reduction results
*   Implemented Multiple Result Columns support:
    * Added `identify_naming_convention` method to ComputeFrameWork
*   Updated DimensionalityReductionFeatureGroup:
    * Now uses multiple result columns pattern instead of arrays
*   Implemented ForecastingFeatureGroup with Pandas support:
    * Added support for multiple forecasting algorithms (linear, ridge, randomforest, etc.)
    * Implemented automatic feature engineering for time series data
    * Added artifact support for saving and loading trained models
*   Implemented NodeCentralityFeatureGroup with Pandas support:
    * Added support for multiple centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, pagerank)
    * Implemented matrix-based centrality calculations without requiring external graph libraries
    * Added support for both directed and undirected graphs


## What's Left to Build

*   Populate the memory bank files with more detailed information.
*   Update the `.clinerules` file with project-specific patterns.
*   Implement the core functionality of the mloda project.

## Current Status

The memory bank has been initialized with basic information. Documentation has been improved with README.md files in key directories. A new aggregated feature group pattern has been implemented with both Pandas and PyArrow support, allowing for efficient aggregation operations on different compute frameworks. The TimeWindowFeatureGroup has been implemented to support time-based window operations. The MissingValueFeatureGroup has been implemented to handle missing values in data using various imputation methods. 

The FeatureChainParserConfiguration has been implemented to support configuration-based feature creation, allowing features to be created from options rather than explicit feature names. This enhances the flexibility of the framework and simplifies feature creation in client code. The AggregatedFeatureGroup has been enhanced with this configuration-based approach, and integration tests have been added to demonstrate the functionality.

The TextCleaningFeatureGroup and ClusteringFeatureGroup have been implemented to support text preprocessing and data clustering operations. The GeoDistanceFeatureGroup has been implemented to calculate distances between geographic points using various distance metrics, further expanding the framework's capabilities for geospatial analysis.

The implementation of configurable_feature_chain_parser has been unified across all feature groups, improving consistency and maintainability.

Support for Multiple Result Columns has been added, allowing feature groups to return multiple related columns using a naming convention pattern. This enhances the flexibility of the framework by enabling a single feature computation to produce multiple related outputs.

The ForecastingFeatureGroup has been implemented to support time series forecasting with multiple algorithms and artifact saving/loading capabilities.

The NodeCentralityFeatureGroup has been implemented to calculate various centrality metrics for nodes in a graph, providing insights into the importance and influence of nodes in network data. This feature group supports multiple centrality metrics and both directed and undirected graphs, making it versatile for different types of network analysis tasks.

## Known Issues

* FeatureSet are created unintuitive:  
feature_set = FeatureSet()
feature_set.add(feature)

* Options.data cannot contain dictionaries as values:
  * The Feature class's __hash__ method tries to hash the options.data dictionary
  * When options.data contains a dictionary as a value, it causes "TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'"
  * Workaround: Use JSON serialization for complex data structures in options.data
