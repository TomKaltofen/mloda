# Progress

## What Works

*   Successfully read the `README.md` file and all files in the `docs/` directory.
*   Created the initial memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `activeContext.md`.
*   Added README.md files to top-level directories: `mloda_core/`, `mloda_plugins/`, and `tests/` to improve documentation.
*   Added description and versioning capabilities to AbstractFeatureGroup
*   Created a dedicated `feature_groups.md` file in the memory bank to document Feature Groups

## What's Left to Build

*   Populate the memory bank files with more detailed information.
*   Update the `.clinerules` file with project-specific patterns.
*   Implement the core functionality of the mloda project.

## Current Status

The memory bank has been initialized with basic information. Documentation has been improved with README.md files in key directories.

## Known Issues

*   None identified.
