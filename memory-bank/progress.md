# Progress

## What Works

*   Successfully read the `README.md` file and all files in the `docs/` directory.
*   Created the initial memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `activeContext.md`.
*   Added README.md files to top-level directories: `mloda_core/`, `mloda_plugins/`, and `tests/` to improve documentation.
*   Added description and versioning capabilities to AbstractFeatureGroup
*   Created a dedicated `feature_groups.md` file in the memory bank to document Feature Groups
*   Implemented BaseAggregatedFeatureGroup with Pandas support for common aggregation operations
*   Created modular folder structure for feature group implementations
*   Implemented PyArrow version of the aggregated feature group
*   Implemented TimeWindowFeatureGroup with both Pandas and PyArrow support

## What's Left to Build

*   Populate the memory bank files with more detailed information.
*   Update the `.clinerules` file with project-specific patterns.
*   Implement the core functionality of the mloda project.

## Current Status

The memory bank has been initialized with basic information. Documentation has been improved with README.md files in key directories. A new aggregated feature group pattern has been implemented with both Pandas and PyArrow support, allowing for efficient aggregation operations on different compute frameworks. The TimeWindowFeatureGroup has been implemented to support time-based window operations.

## Known Issues

*   None identified.
