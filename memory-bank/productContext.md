# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The mloda project exists to address the challenges and inefficiencies in traditional data and feature engineering workflows. It aims to provide a more flexible, resilient, and scalable solution for data practitioners.

## Problems It Solves

*   Redundant data work
*   Complex feature dependencies
*   Inconsistent data management
*   Lack of seamless transitions between development phases
*   Difficulty in maintaining high data quality, governance, and scalability

## How It Should Work

mloda should work by:

*   Providing a framework for defining transformations rather than managing static states.
*   Automatically selecting the right plugins for each task.
*   Enabling efficient querying and processing of complex features.
*   Managing feature dependencies automatically.
*   Orchestrating dependencies between Feature Groups, compute frameworks, and extenders.
*   Allowing the sharing and reuse of plugins through a centralized repository.
*   Unifying various tools into one cohesive solution.

## User Experience Goals

*   Streamlined feature engineering process
*   Repeatable feature creation
*   Easy implementation of best practices
*   Reusable features
*   Optimized feature processing
*   High-quality data practices
*   Clear split roles by users, engineers, and owners speaking the same language
